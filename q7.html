    <h1>If I had an existing account at OnlineShoes, do I need to create a new one?</h1>
       <p> Yes, you will need to make a new account. Under the new operator, OnlineShoes does not have any information about previous orders, purchase history, or any previous business that was done under the old operator.
        
        Weâ€™ve made the process to make a new account quick and simple. By creating an account you can keep a wishlist to manage the products you want most, store your payment methods and shipping address for a faster checkout,
         and can track your orders as well as review your order history.</p>
